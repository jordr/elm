/**
 * @defgroup data Data Structures
 *
 * This module groups together classes implementing storage data structure. It is new in ELM 2.0
 * and try to extend and to make easier the use of classes from @ref gen_datastruct module.
 * The main differences includes:
 * @li shorter names for classes and for iterators,
 * @li include in the @ref main elm name space,
 * @li more STL compliance,
 * @li more operators overloaded.
 *
 * In addition, their documentation includes several topic allowing a better understanding
 * of their work to help choosing the better data structure:
 * @li complexity (average and worst) of basic operations like add and remove,
 * @li basic memory and element relative memory foot print.
 *
 * As for old data structures, the following topics applies:
 * @li concepts implemented by the data structure are provided,
 * @li a data structure must not be modified while an iterator is active on it unless specific methods are provided.
